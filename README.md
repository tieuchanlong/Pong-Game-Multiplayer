# Pong-Game-Multiplayer
## Description
This is the code base for the Pong Multiplayer Game using Mirror and Unity

## Features
* Implement Multiplayer system using Mirror library
* Implement loosely-coupled codes using Zenject
* Implement singleton for game setting

## Challenges
I think the biggest challenge of this project would be applying Multiplayer Mirror into the game that involves physics. However, that can be solved by putting the pluck as local to each player and only the players are transferred between LAN.
Doing so, the pluck can move around based on the position of the player.

## Programming Language
C#

## Major Components
* Mirror
* UNET
* Unity
* Zenject

## Innovation
There will be update in the futures to add more effects on the field and such.
